Customer Segmentation is a crucial technique in data analytics that helps businesses group customers based on purchasing behavior, demographics, and preferences. This project builds a Customer Segmentation System to provide insights that can improve marketing strategies, personalize recommendations, and optimize customer engagement.

📌 Features

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handle missing values, outliers, and standardize data.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualize customer distributions, spending behavior, and demographic trends.

🤖 Clustering Algorithms – Apply K-Means, Hierarchical, or DBSCAN to segment customers.

🛠️ Feature Engineering – Create meaningful features from raw data for better segmentation.

📈 Dashboard & Visualization – Interactive dashboards with charts for easy understanding of customer clusters.

📂 Dataset Sources

You can find relevant datasets from:

📌 Kaggle
 – Search for “Customer Segmentation Dataset”

📌 Google Dataset Search
 – Explore business-related datasets

(For testing, you can start with the “Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset” from Kaggle.)

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)

Jupyter Notebook for development and EDA

Streamlit / Dash / Power BI (for dashboard visualization)

🚀 How It Works

Load Dataset → Import raw customer data

Data Preprocessing → Clean & normalize features

EDA → Explore trends & patterns

Clustering → Apply ML algorithms (e.g., K-Means)

Visualization → Plot clusters & build dashboard

Insights → Identify high-value, price-sensitive, or loyal customers

📊 Example Output

Cluster 1: High spenders, younger demographic

Cluster 2: Budget-conscious, older demographic

Cluster 3: Occasional shoppers with mid-level income

📌 Future Enhancements

🔍 Integrate deep learning models for advanced segmentation

🌍 Apply to real-world datasets from retail/e-commerce

📱 Deploy as a web app for businesses
